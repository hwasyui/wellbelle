# üí° WellBelle - Disease Detection and Prevention Chatbot

**WellBelle** is a machine-learning powered application that detects potential diseases based on user input symptoms and provides preventive measures. It uses a **Naive Bayes** classifier to predict diseases and generates dynamic responses that inform users about treatment and prevention.

## üß† Features
- **Symptom-Based Disease Detection**: Based on user input symptoms, WellBelle predicts the likely disease.
- **Dynamic Responses**: The chatbot generates human-like responses with details about the disease, treatment, and prevention.
